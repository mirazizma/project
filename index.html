				<b>Education Requirements</b>
				<p>
					Hairstylists usually need a high school diploma or GED to apply to cosmetology school and typically graduate in 9 months to a year with an associate's degree in cosmetology. Most states require hairstylists to be licensed. In some states, a license is a one-time exam or application, while others require continuing education credits or periodic re-certification. Hairstylists typically take courses like shampooing, coloring, hair care, hair design and styling. Hairstylists continue their education throughout their careers to stay current with technology and hairstyling trends.</p>

				<b>Required Skills
				</b>
				<p>
					Hairstylists need to be good listeners to fulfill the needs of the client. Sales skills are helpful as well because salons often make a profit from the hair care products they sell. The ability to adapt to changing situations is important due to the variety of clients and their needs. Business and marketing skills are vital for hairstylists interested in opening their own salon or barbershop.

				<b>Employment and Salary Outlook
				</b>
				<p>
					Hairstylists were expected to see faster than average job growth of 13% from 2016-2026, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS predicted that the rising demand for advanced hair treatments should fuel the growth of these positions. Full-time hairstylists, hairdressers and cosmetologists earned a median yearly wage of $24,730 in 2018, according to the BLS, but many hairstylists are self-employed or work part-time, so actual wages can vary widely.
